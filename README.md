## A Dash-Based Tool for Analyzing the Hydrogen Transition
Global decarbonization initiatives and the subsequent energy transition have catalyzed an evolution in hydrogen production methods that address CO2 emissions. Hydrogen is now produced with cleaner fossil fuel inputs—largely natural gas—and combined with CO2 carbon capture to create a low-emissions product called ‘Blue Hydrogen.’ There exists, as well, a no-emissions product called 'Green Hydrogen' quantified by the use of renewablely sourced electrolysis of proton-promoting species. With the burgeoning use of hydrogen in the global industrial ecosystem (namely mobility, power, & NH3), the need for cleaner and more efficient production pathways of hydrogen has become more important than ever. Using existing global production technologies of H2 and their corresponding output streams, we attempt to create an economic quantifier based on regional production trends; which, in turn, industry professional may use to better determine plant construction parameters and economic viability. The further optimization of carbon capture technologies considers the fundamental chemistries of amine capture methods. Further assessments are highlighted regarding the interplay between regional ammonia generationa and the cost minimization for aforementioned amine carbon capture.
